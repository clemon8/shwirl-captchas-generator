This "book" contains two stories: [BOOK 1: THE HEARTBREAKERS] [Complete] "When I met Oliver Perry, I had no clue he was the lead singer for The Heartbreakers. Little did he know, I was the only girl in the world who hated his music." - Stella Walter [BOOK 2: THE QUEEN OF HEARTS] [In Progress] "When I met Alec Williams, I almost fainted. Embarrassing, I know, but how often does a regular girl get to meet a famous heartthrob?" - Felicity Jole "Watch where you’re going nerd!" Someone said knocking me down, while sending my books flying. I let out a sigh as I crouched down, collecting my books from the floor. Once I got up I saw the person who called me nerd a few seconds ago was standing in front of me wearing a smug expression. "What's wrong nerd? Cat got your tongue?" I looked around the hallway, noticing that we’ve drawn a crowd. "What are you mute?" I rolled my eyes as I began to walk away, only to be pulled back and slammed against the lockers. I heard a few gasps coming from our audience. He seemed like a jerk, and judging by what he had just done, I was right. However, he was extremely good looking I had to give him that, with dark brown hair seemed sticking out in all directions and dark brown eyes. "Listen nerd, I don't know who you think you are but no one walks away from me when I talk to them. Got it?" He hissed at me. I let out a chuckle. This guy was unbelievable. "You don't own me, so I suggest you let go of me before I do something that you will regret." I said in a bored tone. His brown eyes narrowed at me, as he let out what seems to be a forced out laugh. "Oh, so the nerd does talk." I heard a few people snickering as he let go of my arm. "I am going to let you go, nerd. But, trust me this isn't over." He whispered into my ear. * Alice "Ali" Montclair has a secret she's the daughter of the man who runs the country- The President.
